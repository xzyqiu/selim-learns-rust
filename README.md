# selim-learns-rust 🦀

this is where i'm learning rust. just messing around and building random stuff to figure out how this language works.

that's it lol

## why rust?

idk it seemed cool and everyone says it's fast. plus the compiler yells at you which is lowkey helpful.

*this is a learning project so the code is messy obviosuly*
