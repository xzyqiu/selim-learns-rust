# selim-learns-rust 🦀

this is where i'm learning rust. just messing around and building random stuff to figure out how this language works.

that's it

## why rust?

it's fast and the compiler yells at you which is lowk helpful.

i'm using this to learn: https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html
